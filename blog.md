# Research

As part of my master's degree, I conducted research on several topics, both independently and collaboratively. Below are some examples of my work. 
##### [Ethical Dilemma of Advanced Technology: AI Associated Risks](/blog_posts/AI_Associated_Risks.pdf)
##### [Google-Knowing](/blog_posts/Google-knowing_essay.pdf)

# Articles 

My articles are **inspired by the challenges** I faced during my learning journey. I will continue to update this blog as I overcome more challenges.
##### [How To Add a Linked Table of Content to Your Jupyter Notebook](/blog_posts/how_to_add_a_table_of_content.md)
